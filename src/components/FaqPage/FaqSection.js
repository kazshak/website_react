            <h3>1. The MLS &amp; How It Works</h3>
            <p>The MLS (Multiple Listing Service) local database is the most powerful tool used by real estate agents to find a home 
                for the buyers they represent. Agents search MLS for homes that meet their buyer's criteria. They can search by numerous 
                categories, including area, price, square footage, number of bedrooms, number of baths, and much more.</p>
            <p>Agents book appointments to show their clients from the information provided on the MLS listing.  The showing 
                instructions are provided by the listing agent.</p>

            <h3>2. Why Use A Lockbox?</h3>
            <p>Lockboxes are not required, but they are ideal for having secure and convenient home showings. Buyers prefer sellers not
                be home during the showing.  This allows buyers the time necessary to look at the home in detail and have open conversations
                while looking.  This sometimes eliminates a second showing before making and offer.  Sellers prefer a lockbox because 
                it allows agents to show the home when the seller is at work or away. Lockboxes also enable last-minute and short notice 
                showings, which often are the best, most motivated buyers (such as relocation buyers in town for a short time who need to 
                buy a home quickly).</p>
